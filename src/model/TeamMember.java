 * @version 1.003 2020-12-10 Rokas
 * version 1.003 notes
 * constructor role setter from version 2 was always setting Team_Member role and was not taking the input from the constructor fixed
 * deleted teamMemberTaskList added Team class, changed methods add tasks/remove tasks
 * v1.002 reverse(fix) changed the team member constructor to not use single setmethods, cause it can create empty spaces etc
 * added protections to setters which were probably deleted in v1.002
 * took out exceptions will add them later no way to handle them now
