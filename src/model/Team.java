 * @author Nicolae Cernean(edited)
 * @version 1.1 2020-12-07
 * @version 1.11 2020-12-10 Rokas
 * version 1.11 notes
 * added toString method,
 * renamed removeTeamMember(String teamMemberID)  to removeTeamMemberByID(String teamMemberID)
 * Created new removeTeamMember(TeamMember teamMember) method
 * added protections to some methods
 * changed method getAllTeamMembers to return Team not the Array
 * changed getTeamMembers by name to return ArrayList, cause Array was throwing exceptions and was creating empty spots
 * changed getTeamMembers by experience to return ArrayList, cause Array was throwing exceptions and was creating empty spots
 * changed getTeamMembers by email to return one team member cause emails are unique
 * assign a task to a team member is redundant cause taskList is empty you can't find anything in it.
